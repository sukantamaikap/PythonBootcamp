# PythonBootcamp

Tutorial for introduction to Python. This presentation assumes familiarity with Java and compares the python features with Java at each stage. The aim is not to be a expert in Python, but get to know enough about Python to start solving problems. This presentation should take roughly an hour and can be separated into 3 sections :

* Introduction to Python
* Problem 1 (Presenter codes with all)
* Problem 2 : Exercise for the participants

This roughly touches : numpy, matplotlib & scikit-learn.The presenter is encouraged to do all the introduction section on terminal or ipython. The preoblems can be coded on any python editor.

The jupyter notebook version is present here : https://github.com/sukantamaikap/Python-Bootcamp-Notebook-Format
